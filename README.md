pycon-code-of-conduct
=====================

This is a "fork" of the 2013 PyCon code of conduct including the staff and attendee guides. 

Thank you to Adria Richards and many others with the Python Software Foundation and Python community for recommending
that we publicly discuss and version control these documents so changes can be suggested, wording corrected and we can
continue to iterate, as a community on these policies and procedures.

PyCon and the community as a whole are still very much in a learning process, the conference is 11 years old and still
evolving daily. Each year we see massive improvements (such as the code of conduct and staff procedures) and PyCon 2013
was no different.

We hope, as a team we can iterate and improve continually.

No changes are final until approved by the PyCon Chair / Staff and versions in place for a given year will be clearly
marked, the website contents on us.pycon.org will clearly state the revision of the documents posted.
